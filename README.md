# private_tor_bridges

Email me at tortunnel@protonmail.com and I will provide you with a private TOR bridge for your personal use. Unlike the public or semi-public TOR bridges offered by the TOR project these servers are completely unlisted and can be customized for greater evasion.  Please provide your country of origin and/or the type of blocking you are trying to evade to allow the server configuration to be optimized for your situation. Please describe your intended use of the tunnel and requests will be accepted on a case by case basis. Since traffic will be sent directly to the TOR network, I will not have visability into the sites vistied but I do require that all requestors certify that you do not intend to use the server to access pornography, illegal drugs, or conduct hacking. This service is intended to help circumvent censorship, not harbor illegal and/or immoral activity.

Communication will remain anonymous. This service is currenly being offered for free of change on a case by case basis. Bitcoin donations are alwasy welcome. Wallet address available upon request.


Use the attached PGP key for added security.
